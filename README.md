# My Nixvim Configuration

This configuration sets up my basic `nvim` configuration. Additionally it
specifies specific configurations for different coding languages and projects
I'm working on.

## Default Configuration

### Options

I tend to use the same options accross all my configurations.

### Keymaps

This one is tricky, I use the same basic key maps accross configs, **but** there
are some additional keymaps I use based on the plugins. For example, my obsidian
plugin has additional keymaps that are super specific to obsidian.

### Colorschemes

It's probably time to switch to a new color scheme at some point but in general
this also stays the same accross all my configurations.

### Plugins

- Tree Sitter
- Telescope
- Zen Mode

## Editor Config

### Plugins

- LSP
- CMP (Autocomplete)
- Formatter (conform)
- Lint with credo
- Test runner (vim-test neotest)
- Tab bar (lualine)
- File manager (maybe include ranger - oil.nvim)

## Obsidian

Need to figure out some better way of doing this but I def don't want the
Obsidian configuration in my standard `nvim` configuration.
